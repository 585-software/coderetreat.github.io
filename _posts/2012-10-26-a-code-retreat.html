<p>When you can&#x2019;t talk, your code really does have to speak for itself.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during our weekly meta-skills session, we had a&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/about">code retreat</a>&#xA0;(thank you&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines</a>).&#xA0;</p>
<p>The purpose of a code retreat is to get back to the&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI">fundementals</a>&#xA0;and hone one&#x2019;s craft by escaping the regular routine of pushing to production.&#xA0;In many ways, Dev Bootcamp is an extended code retreat. Very few of the repos we produce for&#xA0;exercises&#xA0;make their way into functioning apps (at least at this point in the program), which leaves us a lot of freedom. But that aside, we, like most engineers, have gotten into a fairly intense routine, and the break was refreshing.</p>
<p>For 45 minute sprints we&#x2019;d pair with a student or instructor and try to get as far into a particular problem as possible. Everyone in the room was attempting the same challenge. And we repeated this 4 times, with 4 different partners on the same challenge. There were three caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>All our code had to be test-driven with RSpec.&#xA0;</li>
<li>After each 45 minute sprint, every line of code we&#x2019;d written had to be deleted. Yes, gone forever.&#xA0;</li>
<li>During one of the final sprints, we weren&#x2019;t allowed to talk. We could merely volley RSpec and test solutions between partners as a means of communication. Our code had to, truly, speak for itself. This exercise, in my opinion, has,&#xA0;more than any other we&#x2019;ve gone through thus far, revealed the necessity of precise tests and naming conventions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results were remarkable. The knowledge base in the room around this particular problem expanded as partners shuffled. Particularly thoughtful solutions were shared. People didn&#x2019;t feel the normal pressures of writing code for the sake of the problem at hand so much as writing code for its own sake (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://serialmilk.tumblr.com/post/34154656635/code-is-poetry-not-prose">poetry</a>, as one of my cohorts put it). And,&#xA0;I found myself enjoying the coding process more than I have in a while.</p>
<p>We have no code to show from the retreat. Nothing but our current capacity code, with its newly sharped style and appreciation of Ruby&#x2019;s nuances, shows its impact. And that is the beauty of a code retreat.</p>
