title: GLOBAL CODE RETREAT 2011 IN BERLIN
preview: I attended the Global Coderetreat event initialized by Corey Haines2. The general purpose of this event was to get a bunch of hackers together to implement Conway’s Game of Life.

<h2 id="setting-up-goals">Setting up goals</h2>
<p>As <strong>J. B. Rainsberger</strong> mentioned in his article about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" title="four elements of simple design">four elements of simple design</a>, it is best to setup goals for your retreat to get most out of it. Here is a list of what I achieved in every section:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being a mentor of TDD: I taught <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/dedan" title="dedan">dedan</a> how to use TDD, why<br> TDD helps you to think about your design</li>
<li>Being a mentor of BDD: Showing a fellow Rubyist how to do BDD</li>
<li>Doing something completely stupid: I played <em>evil coder</em> and <em>ping-pong pairing</em> with<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/tilosoenke" title="@tilosoenke">@tilosoenke</a> - we couldn&#x2019;t communicate with<br>
words, only with code, one writing tests and other the implementation of the tests.</li>
<li>Discuss about names: We said together and discussed about right names for methods, variables, and<br> classes. We concluded that good names saves you scary comments in your code</li>
<li>Explain Ruby to a Java-Programmer</li>
<li>Being mentored about Lisp: We solved the whole &#x2018;Game of Live&#x2019; in common Lisp<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a rel="nofollow" href="#fn:lisp">3</a></sup>, while<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/hanshuebner" title="@HansHuebener">@HansHuebener</a> explained me the<br>
strength and beauty in common Lisp, while the programmer explained me the strength and beauty of<br>
Lisp.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It was great to get so many people with so many different skills and mindsets together, exchange<br> experience and encouraging others to try something new. I will definitely have a closer look on<br>
Lisp to enhance my Ruby style.</p>
