<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This observer has noted a repeated waste of time by attendees of the<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/">Coderetreats</a> he has attended. Herein is described a<br> simple way to be better prepared when you attend your next Coderetreat</p>
<h2>Observational Data</h2>
<p>This past weekend was the Global Day of Coderetreat and I attended the<br> one in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat">Cambridge, Mass</a>. This was my third and I<br> again saw an annoyance I want to get out of my head.</p>
<p>First, let me recapitulate the idea of the code retreat. The<br> participants work on the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conways_Game_of_Life">Conway&#x2019;s Game of Life</a> programming<br> problem in 45 minute intervals in pairs, throwing away the code after<br> every iteration. Some iterations have interesting constraints added;<br> such as &#x2018;no primitives&#x2019;, &#x2018;no ifs&#x2019;, or &#x2018;silent paring&#x2019;.</p>
<p>I have noticed that at each coderetreat I&#x2019;ve attended some people spend<br> time (usually only in the first session luckily) fighting with their<br> environments to get the point where they can start coding. To me any<br> time spent setting up the environment is wasted time when you have 45<br> minutes. I&#x2019;m not saying that this was a /huge/ issue &#x2013; but a very<br> little bit of preparation can save plenty of time during the event.</p>
<h2>An Initial Attempt for a Personal Solution</h2>
<p>Given that I saw (and felt, when pairing with someone who was<br> unprepared) this problem at the Chicago coderetreat (held the day after<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">SCNA</a>), I made sure I had a ruby and Java project all set up so<br> that I had a failing test (<code>true == false</code>). That way I knew that<br> everything was all set: all needed libraries, any special configuration<br> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">autotest</a> &amp; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">rspec</a> always gives me a little bit of<br> hassle), any other annoying little thing was done. I even went so far<br> as to push them up to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://.github.com">GitHub</a> so others could use them to.<br> (git makes deleting the code after an iteration very easy: <code>git reset<br> --hard HEAD &amp;&amp; git clean -fqx</code>).</p>
<p>It turns out that I didn&#x2019;t need to do this. There was already a GitHub<br> repository that did what I needed and much more:<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/coreyhaines/coderetreat">coreyhaines/coderetreat</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given that the above repository is set up for 10 programming languages<br> currently, it is likely that the ones you want to use are already<br> there. Simply cloning the repository and doing a quick smoke test will<br> ensure that your environment is ready for the session.</p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t find your favorite language &#x2013; or the skeleton provided<br> doesn&#x2019;t work as well as it could &#x2013; send a pull request (I tweaked the<br> ruby starting point to let autotest work with rspec right away).</p>
