<p>Of the 50 participants that rsvp&apos;ed to the event, about 25 showed up:</p>

<p>We started at 9:30 am and our general plan for the day was the following:</p>
<div><p>1: get our feet wet and try to understand the problems</p>
<p>2: maybe try something other than 2D array?</p>
<div>3: focus on names during this session</div>
<div>4: think about working on exercises either super TDD or super OO.</div>
<div>5: go nuts and try something totally different</div>
<div>6: power went out around 5 pm so everyone went home</div>
</div>
<p>Mostly everyone worked on Ruby on Rails or Javascript.&#xA0; One guy tried using Dart and another tried Matlab during one of the sessions.&#xA0;</p>
<div>I missed my Skype call with Samir for 9:30 because we initially had problems accessing the wifi at Engine Yard (sorry Samir!)&#xA0; We were able to make our 10 am Skype Call with Cincinnati and seems like everything over there was going great.&#xA0; We also had a Skype call with Corey later on in the day while he was in&#xA0;Honolulu&#xA0;and that was exciting.&#xA0;<br> <br> After each 45 minute session, we had a 15 minute introspective talk.&#xA0; We were able to take videos of most of these wrap ups and lots of photos, which we are going to post soon.</div>
<div><br> Beverages and beer were provided by Engine Yard and there was much rejoicing.&#xA0; We had plenty of breakfast items and snacks but went out to grab lunch. &#xA0;Next Coderetreat, I plan on purchasing less breakfast items and instead purchase simple sandwiches for everyone in case people would rather stay at the office during the break.<br> <br> One of our participants brought us shirts, stickers and wrestling head gears from the Mexico Coderetreat. &#xA0;<br> <br> People started trickling out/getting tired around 4 pm.&#xA0; Power went out around 5 and people were pretty tired so we wrapped it up.<br> <br> Some of the feedback we received included having more than one problem set (other than Conway&apos;s Game of Life) as the participants were mostly able to figure out the code by the 4th session.&#xA0; Second feedback was having pre-assigned partners for the 1st session and then letting everyone choose whoever they wanted to pair with after that. &#xA0;<br> <br> Overall, everyone really enjoyed the event and said they would come back to it again. &#xA0;I met up with one participant to return him his charger and he told me that he was looking forward to the next one!<br> <br> Thank you Corey for making all of this happen and for the help and thank you Jim for guiding me in the right direction.<br> <br> Cristina</div>
