title: Notes from Bilbao Global Day of Coderetreat
preview: Hi everybody!
---
<p>Hi everybody!</p>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>18 brave programmers (from 20 registered) got together this Saturday in the premises of Plain Concepts in Bilbao.</div>
<div>We had decided to start late (10:00h) so everybody would get the opportunity to get some rest, and to drive/commute comfortably.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>The group was quite&#xA0;<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">heterogenous</span>; from fluent TDD-<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">ers</span>&#xA0;to some guy not having a clue of TDD. It was the first&#xA0;code-retreat&#xA0;for more than 12, but some of them had already attended some&#xA0;<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">dojo</span>-like events in the area (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://katayunos.com/" target="_blank">http://<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">katayunos</span>.com/</a>), so they somehow were tuned in the proper wave-length.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>Languages; .NET, Java, Groovy,&#xA0;<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">PHP</span>, Python, Javascript.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>We start with Corey&apos;s video and the sponsors&apos; material, with some references to the Global Day demographics.</div>
<div>We then went through an explanation of the spirit of the Code-retreat and the rules.</div>
<div>The Simple Design principles were also explained, and the Game of Life introduced.</div>

</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>First session was held to get hands dirty, and they were allowed to work with their friends (if any).</div>
<div>Those with the &quot;Blank Page Syndrome&quot; were encouraged to start step-by-step, so the tests would help them find the way. Others fell into the &quot;One Test to Rule them All&quot; temptation and suffered the time constraints. So it was only natural that the virtues of walking in small steps were discussed in the retrospective.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>The second session got re-arranged couples, and the &quot;Primitive Obsession&quot; smell was the main theme to deal with. People started feeling the heat and they all seemed quite active and courageous.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>Third session was half a continuation of the previous, with most of the couples playing &quot;Ping-pong TDD&quot;.</div>
<div>One of the best quotes of the day comes from that retrospective; &quot;I&apos;ve learned that my pair can be a big bastard, and so I&apos;ve discovered I&apos;m a big one too&quot; :)</div>
<div>The importance of the Test being decoupled from the inner details of the implementation was one of the facts people got from this exercise.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>

<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>We got more free time than intended for lunch due to some delivery problems with the food, so we use the time taking the first beer of the day in a place nearby. Some of the guys remained in the office talking of technical approaches, though. Intense people indeed!</div>
<div>We did the&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://random.org/" target="_blank">random.org</a>&#xA0;thing to share the giveaways, and we made three connections to other&#xA0;<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">coderetreats</span>&#xA0;in Spain so people would notice they were not alone :)</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>I had toyed with the idea of introducing a &quot;mute&quot; session, but found that so much silence after lunch could lead us to a sleepy mood.</div>
<div>So we started the fourth session with some brain challenges; polymorphism, &quot;no-<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">IFs</span>&quot;, and &quot;avoid [gs]<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">etters</span>&#xA0;and &apos;tell, don&apos;t ask!&apos;&quot;.</div>
<div>Guys got quite deep into the problem, and some interesting discussions arose. People felt somehow conned with the &quot;no&#xA0;<span class="J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc">IFs</span>&quot; constraint, because they had hoped to get some greater enlightenment, beyond getting out of their comfort zone. Maybe I failed trying to explain this in greater detail.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>At this point, people looked quite tired. We decided to make the 5th session the last one. I let them choose the pairs with which they had felt more productive, and face the last challenge with one thing in mind. &quot;Legibility. Let the code be read as if it was a small story&quot;.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>During this last session some people were pretty&#xA0;exhausted&#xA0;and were not able to keep up with the challenge. Others enjoyed that last chance for &quot;doing it right&quot;, though.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>In the closing circle, even though everybody was quite tired, I felt satisfaction in the air. I got quite surprised (and pleased) with people saying they had learned a lot, and I tried to stress the fact of the&#xA0;code-retreat&#xA0;being more an introspective trip than a traditional course.</div>
<div>We said goodbye... and left to take some beers with a huge, tired smile in the faces.</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>Thank you all for doing it possible! Thank you guys in the global coordination team for doing it so easy!</div>
