title: Why the Global Day of Coderetreat Matters
preview: Why does the Global Day of Coderetreat matter?   Seriously. Oh sure, today, thousands of developers in hundreds of cities across almost every continent are practicing writing code together. That is cool and all, but why should anyone care?  Because practicing our craft is important. We write the software that runs the world. Literally. We need to be good at what we do. The world depends on it. Coderetreat has taught us over the last few years that learning at work (on the job) is inadequate for helping us to become better software developers.  As we join together today, we tell the world that practice is important and that we care about learning how to write better code.  But that is not the only reason why the Global Day of Coderetreat matters it is also a fund-raiser for the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f).

<p>Why does the <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org" target="_blank">Global Day of Coderetreat</a> matter? <br> <br> Seriously. Oh sure, today, thousands of developers in hundreds of cities across almost every continent are practicing writing code together. That is cool and all, but why should anyone care?<br> <br> Because practicing our craft is important. We write the software that runs the world. Literally. We need to be good at what we do. The world depends on it. Coderetreat has taught us over the last few years that learning at work (on the job) is inadequate for helping us to become better software developers.<br> <br> <strong>As we join together today, we tell the world that practice is important and that we care about learning how to write better code.</strong><br> <br> But that is not the only reason why the Global Day of Coderetreat matters: <strong>it is also a fund-raiser for the</strong> <a href="http://coderetreat.org/about/c3f" target="_self">Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f)</a>.</p>
<p>The Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund was established in 2011 with the mission to help support organizations focused on educating new developers. Hard-working groups all over the world are preparing children, women, and minorities to enter the world of software development. These groups matter!</p>
<p>What inspired you to become a software developer? Was there someone who you looked up to that influenced you?</p>
<p>Traditional education systems often fail to prepare the next generation of software developers. Think back to your own education. How much of what you do today did you learn in school? Did you learn modern software development practices like test driven development, pair programming, or relative estimation?<br> <br> In addition, software development continues to be a white, male-dominated industry. This is truly unfortunate. We need more diversity in our industry!<br> <br> Corey Haines started c3f because all of these groups need our support. They are the organizations that will take our entire industry to the next level. They are creating the future of software.<br> <br> So, does the Global Day of Codereate matter? Oh yes. Big Time.<br> <br> Jim++</p>
