<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://alapamui.blogspot.com.es/2011/12/global-day-of-coderetreat-barcelona.html">Last year</a>&#xA0;I was in the&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Code Retreat</a>&#xA0;in Barcelona, held in&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.runroom.com/2011/12/global-day-of-coderetreat-barcelona/">Runroom</a>&#xA0;(their former office), organized by&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://agile-barcelona.org/">Agile-Barcelona</a>&#xA0;and facilitated by&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://jaumejornet.net/">Jaume Jornet</a>. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot, not only about programming, but about teamwork and sharing.</p>
<p>This year the event was planned again in Runroom, but for difficult dates: public holidays and the&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bcndevcon.org/">Barcelona Developers Conference</a>&#xA0;were difficult rivals. And this time I was a facilitator.</p>
<p>I agreed to co-facilitate the event with&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/jrhuerta">Jos&#xE9; E. Rodr&#xED;guez Huerta</a>&#xA0;and I joined the facilitators group and attended a training using Google Hangout. In the training we were people form New Zeland, Sweden and Australia, with an amazing trainer:&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/jthurne">Jim Hurne</a>. The organization of the event, the sessions, the connections with other cities, and the focus of the exercises were all good lessons.</p>
<p>Then I started contacting with the groups around Spain that were having the same event to organize live connections.</p>
<p>Everybody was distilling an energy that was impossible to not be infected.</p>

<p>The day of the event 11 guys showed up in Barcelona (30 had confirmed), and we opened a Hangout during all day so we could be chatting with other cities. Valencia (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/borillo">Ricardo</a>), Madrid (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#!/JuanmaGomeR">Juanma</a>), Bilbao (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/jorgeuriarte">Jorge</a>), Berlin (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/dziemid">Greg</a>) and Viena (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/michael_leber">Michael</a>) were some of our connections. We followed the schedule and had sessions with interesting&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog">restrictions</a>&#xA0;(ping pong, no conditional, ask don&apos;t tell,...) and the programmers used Ruby, C#, Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The retrospective was interesting. They suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a retrospective reviewing the code someone has writer</li>
<li>Choose a language to use everybody in some iterations (and learn the basics of language beforehand)</li>
<li>Try a randori, maybe with this language.</li>
<li>More on legacy code.</li>
<li>And choose a cool mechanism for the raffle&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of their confort zone. No pressure for getting the problem done. Try new things. Pair with new people. Thinking in a different way.</p>
<p>This crazy idea from Corey Haines deserves my respect. So many people crazy to become better professionals. And having fun.</p>
<p>Big Thank You.</p>
