<p>At least the one I attended on Saturday &#x2013; My first one.</p>
<h3>What is a code retreat, you&#x2019;re asking?</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cornelis/status/241840053339430912"><img class="align-left" src="http://findingmarblesdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/coderetreat.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&amp;width=300" width="300"></a>A bunch of people who want to improve their coding and unit testing skills meet for a day. Everyone has their IDEs and testing frameworks ready to go. You get to tackle the same problem multiple times. We had 7 blocks, each consisting of 45 minutes coding followed by 15 minutes retrospectives. In each coding phase you pair program with someone else. To spice things up, there&#x2019;s a new constraint for each round, e.g. &#x201C;No IF-statements allowed&#x201D;. After each round you throw away the code. *gasp* Heresy!</p>
<h3>Why would you do a code retreat?</h3>
<p>For deliberate practice. There&#x2019;s this famous analogy: Musicians spend a lot of time practicing, then give a few concerts. Software developers &#x2013; who often build something they&#x2019;ve never build before &#x2013; spend all of their time &#x201C;giving the concerts&#x201D; and hardly ever just practice the basics, let alone with someone else. A code retreat is an opportunity to learn</p>
<ul>
<li>new ways of thinking / approaching a task from your pairing partner</li>
<li>to take really small steps</li>
<li>new languages<br> (Code retreats are not language specific. I got to code in JavaScript, Java and Ruby. Java was the least common denominator &#x2013; it works for everyone.)</li>
<li>new shortcuts, IDEs, frameworks, &#x2026;</li>
<li>to throw away code<span id="more-1324"></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Our constraints for the 7 phases were:</h3>
<ol>
<li>None</li>
<li>Ping-Pong &#x2013; A writes test, B writes code to pass test, B writes next test, A writes code to pass test, &#x2026;</li>
<li>Law of Demeter &#x2013; No more than one &#x201C;.&#x201D; per expression allowed, so no objectFoo.getBar().doFoo() &#x2013; Following this law leads to looser coupling</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activities/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it">TDD as if you meant it</a></li>
<li>No naked primitives &#x2013; No ints, no booleans, &#x2026;</li>
<li>No If &#x2013; Yeah, that&#x2019;s a hard one&#x2026;</li>
<li>Each pair could choose individually from a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog">long list</a> &#x2013; We chose &#x201C;Find the loophole&#x201D;</li>
</ol>
<h3>My takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>As I&#x2019;m not a developer, I was afraid to slow my pairing partners down. No need to worry: Code retreat tasks, such as the classic <a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/gol">&#x201C;Conway&#x2019;s Game of Life&#x201D;</a>, are quite simple and there were other non-developers attending.<br> It&#x2019;s helps if you&#x2019;ve at least seen unit tests before, though.</li>
<li>I take way too big steps</li>
<li>In the &#x201C;no primitives&#x201D; round I learned to use enums instead of booleans and they make the code more &#x201C;speaking&#x201D;</li>
<li>A code retreat is great fun, but also exhausting. 7 sessions is one too many.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I&#x2019;d like to attend a Legacy code retreat, where you learn to refactor old brittle code.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the facilitators <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.orchit.de/">Patrick Corneli&#xDF;en</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://shishkin.org/">Sergey Shishkin</a>, to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.innoq.com/de">innoQ</a> for hosting the event and to all attendees for making my first code retreat an awesome experience!</p>
