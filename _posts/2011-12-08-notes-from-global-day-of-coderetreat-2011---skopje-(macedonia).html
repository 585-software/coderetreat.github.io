<p>I want to share few thoughts about my experience facilitating the <a rel="nofollow" title="Global Day of Coderetreat in Skopje (Macedonia)" href="../../events/global-day-of-coderetreat-in-skopje-macedonia">Global Day of Coderetreat event in Skopje (Macedonia)</a> (photos available <a rel="nofollow" title="Global Day of Coderetreat in Skopje (Macedonia): Photos" href="../../photo/albums/skopje-coderetreat">here</a>).</p>
<p><em>What is Global Day of Coderetreat?</em></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" title="Global Day of Coderetreat" href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Coderetreat</a> is a world-wide event celebrating passion and software craftsmanship. Over 2200 passionate software developers in 90 cities around the world spend the day practicing the craft of software development using the <a rel="nofollow" title="Coderetreat format" href="../../facilitating/structure-of-a-coderetreat">Coderetreat format</a>.</p>
<p><em>What went well?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Skopje was a part of the Global Day of Coderetreat (Global Coderetreat <a rel="nofollow" title="Global Day of Coderetreat map" href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">map</a>)</li>
<li>Pair programming knowledge transfer (participants worked in: Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java and some Erlang at the end)</li>
<li>Direct connect with the event in Barcelona (El Cl&#xE1;sico discussion was fun! :) thanks to <a rel="nofollow" title="Jaume Jornet" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/jaumejornet">Jaume Jornet</a>)</li>
<li>3 local sponsors (big thanks to: <a rel="nofollow" title="Siyelo" href="http://siyelo.com/">Siyelo</a>, <a rel="nofollow" title="Atomidata" href="http://atomidata.com/">Atomidata</a> and <a rel="nofollow" title="Ever-Near" href="http://ever-near.com/">Ever-Near</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What could be improved?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Attendance (there were only 3 pairs - 6 developers; +2 or just +1 pair could have made a big difference)</li>
<li>Focus (we had only 4 good focused sessions practicing software design, and 2 freestyle sessions; with +1 pair it could have been better)</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it was great&#xA0;experience for me organizing this Coderetreat event. I learned many new ideas about Software Design and Agile Coaching.</p>
