<p>On January 15, I facilitated a coderetreat in Cleveland, OH, sponsored by the excellent folks at <a href="http://www.leandog.com/" target="_blank">Leandog Software</a>. While all public community coderetreats are free, we had a $20 refundable attendance deposit with an explanation that any money left over would go directly to the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f). As a result of no-shows and explicit donations by attendees, we were able to raise $400! I immediately looked for a kids programming event to sponsor. Kimberly Bryant from Black Girls Code has been doing a lot of great work with under-served girls, and I thought it would be a fantastic first sponsorship. I contacted Kimberly and have sent our first sponsorship check!</p>
<p>Over the next couple months, I&apos;ll be facilitating some coderetreats with an explicit goal of fund-raising for more kids programming events, including&#xA0;<a href="https://twitter.com/kidscodecamp" target="_blank">KidsCodeCamp</a>&#xA0;and a Black Girls Code event in Chicago in May. I&apos;ll also be publishing more information on how people and organizations can contribute to this cause.</p>
<p>I&apos;m really excited to watch the progress these girls will make during the 6 weeks of the National STEM Video Game Challenge. It is an awesome event, and Kimberly&apos;s work is an inspiration. You can follow their progress on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/blackgirlscode" target="_blank">BlackGirlsCode</a>. I look forward to partnering in the future, as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/index.html" target="_blank">About Black Girls Code</a><br>BlackGirlsCode was founded by Kimberly Bryant a Biotechnology/Engineering professional who received her first taste of computer programming as a freshman in Electrical Engineering back when Fortran and Pascal were still the popular languages for newbies in the computing world and the &apos;Apple Macintosh&apos; was the new kid on the block. Kimberly decided to launch BlackGirlsCode to meet the needs of young women of color who are underrepresented in the currently exploding field of technology. Much has changed since those days and the mission of BlackGirlsCode is to introduce programming and technology to a new generation of coders who will become the leaders and creators of tomorrow. Our goal: Build the Future.</p>
