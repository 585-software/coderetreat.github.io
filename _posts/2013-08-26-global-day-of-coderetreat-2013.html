<p><strong><span class="font-size-4">A Day Like No Other, Global Day of Coderetreat</span></strong></p>
<p>I&apos;m happy to announce this year&apos;s Global Day of Coderetreat will be held on <strong>Saturday, December 14th, 2013</strong>!</p>
<p>Last year, on December 8th, 2012, over 2000 developers in 150 cities through 20 time zones dedicated the day to practicing their craft during the Global Day of Coderetreat 2012. Video calls traversed the globe as groups linked to say hello to other cities and welcomed each other to an amazing day spent working on improving our fundamental development skills. Since Global Day of Coderetreat 2011, we have seen the number of events grow to the point where it is rare to find a weekend without at least 2 workshops happening somewhere in the world. Check out the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004c84674c62aa900e06&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=38.272689,-7.734375&amp;spn=164.696857,90&amp;z=1" target="_blank">map of cities from last year</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the enormous success of the last two years, we are doing it again in 2013! On December 14th, 2013, developers world-wide will once again sit down and share a day like no other; creating a network across the globe of people caring about getting better at what we do: writing maintainable software.</p>
<p>Of course, at its heart coderetreat is a local event organized and facilitated by volunteers. We have had a wonderful group of people step up to host the last two years. This year is no different! We are looking forward to working with old and new hosts and facilitators around the world. We are putting together a great team of global coordinators, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jthurne" target="_blank">Jim Hurne</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adibolb" target="_blank">Adrian Bolboaca</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/volunteerjunkie" target="_blank">Alissa Conaty</a>.</p>
<p>The last two years were <em>awesome</em> and this year is going to be even more amazing. The first GDCR in 2011 started with a blog post putting out the idea of getting maybe 20 cities together on a single day to do a coderetreat and ended with <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004b0b076e7ed3148f35&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=13.007757,146.540268&amp;spn=150.880909,12.304688" target="_blank">94 cities in 14 time zones</a>. Last year, GDCR12 included <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004c84674c62aa900e06&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=38.272689,-7.734375&amp;spn=164.696857,90&amp;z=1" target="_blank">150 cities in 20 time zones</a>.&#xA0; This year, let&apos;s push the limits even further. <strong>Our goal for this year is 200 cities</strong>. With an average of 15-20 developers at each event, this will mean we have 3000-4000 developers around the world sharing in this amazing day. Can we do it? Of course we can!</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks, we will send out out a lot more information about taking part in Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 (GDCR13). So stay tuned by following <a href="https://twitter.com/coderetreat" target="_blank">@coderetreat</a>&#xA0;and the <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/search/?q=%23gdcr13" target="_blank">#gdcr13 hashtag</a>. We&apos;re already seeing events starting to be registered on the <a href="http://bit.ly/gdcr13events" target="_blank">GDCR13 event page</a>.&#xA0;&#xA0;As they get added to the event page, we&apos;re putting them on&#xA0;<a href="http://bit.ly/gdcr13map" target="_blank">the map of registered GDCR 2013 cities</a>.</p>
<p><strong class="font-size-3"><span class="font-size-3">Want to host an event in your city for Global Day of Coderetreat 2013?</span></strong></p>
<p>Hosting a participating event is pretty straightforward. You&apos;ll need to secure a location, get enough local sponsorship for lunch (and possibly morning coffee, if possible, since we do start early), and find a facilitator for the day. We&apos;re working on a sponsorship prospectus that you can use to help explain the day to possible sponsors in your area.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat event in your city for GDCR13, please submit <a href="http://bit.ly/gdcr13forhosts" target="_blank">please submit this form</a>. We will add you to the organizers mailing lists where you can share and get help from other hosts around the world.</p>
<p><strong><span class="font-size-3">Want to become a local or global sponsor of Global Day of Coderetreat 2013?</span></strong></p>
<p>Email me us at <a href="mailto:gdcr@coderetreat.org" target="_blank">gdcr@coderetreat.org</a>, and we will give you more information about the options. We&apos;ll be preparing more information about sponsorship levels, but a global sponsorship secures your place in front of a projected 3000-4000 developers world-wide. Show your support for developers around the world with a global sponsorship. We&apos;ll have some administrative costs (stickers, organizational costs, etc), but the extra sponsorship goes into the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund, a non-profit focused on supporting the goal of teaching kids to program.</p>
<p><strong><span class="font-size-3">Want to help with the global coordination?</span></strong></p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to organize and coordinate a global event like the Global Day of Coderetreat. We&apos;re always looking for new volunteers to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>design and manage the websites</li>
<li>assist with training new hosts and facilitators</li>
<li>create promotional materials and templates for use by local event hosts</li>
<li>answer questions on the event mailing lists</li>
<li>help with general event record-keeping and tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to take-it-up-a-notch and help out with any of the above, then email us at <a href="mailto:gdcr@coderetreat.org" target="_blank">gdcr@coderetreat.org</a>! We would love to have you join the global coordinator team.</p>
