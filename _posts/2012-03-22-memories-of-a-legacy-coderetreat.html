<p>Heya guys,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that we ran the first legacy coderetreat of 2012 in Belgium a little over a week ago. I wrote down a short story about it, that you can read&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://talboomerik.be/2012/03/22/practicing-legacy-rescue-techniques/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;m going to blog about the different sessions we experimented with soon, I&apos;ll keep you posted here as well of course.</p>
