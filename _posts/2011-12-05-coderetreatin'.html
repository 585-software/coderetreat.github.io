<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/coderetreat-session-1.jpg"><img align="left" title="Session 1 at Global Day of Coderetreat" src="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/coderetreat-session-1-300x224.jpg" alt="Session 1 at Global Day of Coderetreat" width="300" height="224"></a>Today, the Global Day of Coderetreat came to Indianapolis. <em>And it was great.</em></p>
<p>13 people chose to spend the whole day on Saturday, December 3rd, in the &quot;common area&quot; at Interactive Intelligence honing their skillz.</p>
<p>By the way, I want to extend a huge <strong>thanks&#xA0;</strong>to Interactive Intelligence for providing the space, a catered lunch, and some breakfast! It was awesome!</p>
<p>This was my first coderetreat, not to mention the first one I&apos;ve hosted and facilitated. I was trusting <a rel="nofollow" title="Corey Haines" href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines&apos;</a>&#xA0;experience when it came to the format, and I was very pleased with how it went. We did 6 45-minute sessions, each time pairing up and implementing Conway&apos;s Game of Life. People used a wide variety of languages throughout the day: ruby, python, C#, java, javascript, even some C++.</p>
<p>Many of the people were new to practices like pairing, and TDD. We also got to explore a lot of design ideas and look at different ways to approach a problem. I really enjoyed being able to throw in various constraints during each session and then to see how it affected the approaches or designs that people came up with.</p>
<p>Overall, I got very positive feedback - it really seemed like a valuable day for everybody, for a wide variety of reasons. By far, people said that the pairing and the <a rel="nofollow" title="Ping Pong Programming" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern">ping/pong TDD</a>&#xA0;were the most enlightening aspects of the day. It was great to have a structured and guided environment for people to explore those concepts that can otherwise be difficult to dig into ad-hoc.</p>
<p>Other things people learned or enjoyed were designing with the&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" title="Tell, Don&apos;t Ask" href="http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">Tell, Don&apos;t Ask</a>&#xA0;approach, and getting exposed to some new languages.</p>
<p>Overall I think it was a huge success. Or at least, I was very pleased with how it went and how it seemed to affect people. :) People grew as software developers today! That&apos;s awesome in and of itself. :)</p>
<p>Thanks to all who attended!!</p>
