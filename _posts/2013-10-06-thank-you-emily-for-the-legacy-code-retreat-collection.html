title: Thank you Emily for The Legacy Code Retreat Collection
preview: In 2012, Emily Bache started a collection on GitHub of three katas specifically selected for use in a Legacy Code Retreat (Tennis, Yahtzee, and Gilded Rose) and invited others to contribute, and contribute they did. The result, in at least 5 languages, can be found here.  Although that work included links over to Cyber-Dojo, those links no longer work.

<p>In 2012, Emily Bache started a collection on GitHub of three katas specifically selected for use in a Legacy Code Retreat (Tennis, Yahtzee, and Gilded Rose) and invited others to contribute, and contribute they did. The result, in at least 5 languages, can be found&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/emilybache/Refactoring-Katas/" target="_blank">here</a>. &#xA0;Although that work included links over to Cyber-Dojo, those links no longer work.&#xA0;</p>
<p>So, I re-ported the work over to Cyber-Dojo, added attribution and a link back to the github repo at the bottom of the instructions pages, and renamed the code and test sources to reflect the exercises. Here are the keys on Cyber-Dojo:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &apos;courier new&apos;, courier;">{<br>Lang: &#xA0; [&quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;G Rose&quot;, &quot;Yahtzy&quot;],<br>CSharp: [&quot;53C59C&quot;, &quot;294BBB&quot;, &quot;D08160&quot;],<br>CPP: &#xA0; &#xA0;[&quot;3DA231&quot;, &quot;77146E&quot;, &quot;FE4865&quot;],<br>Java: &#xA0; [&quot;876748&quot;, &quot;19E971&quot;, &quot;7FD3B4&quot;],<br>JS: &#xA0; &#xA0; [&quot;14DFAF&quot;, &quot;E9C44B&quot;, &#xA0; &#xA0;nill ],&#xA0;<br>Python: [&quot;461D9A&quot;, &quot;C38077&quot;, &quot;0EB11E&quot;],<br>Ruby: &#xA0; [&quot;239135&quot;, &#xA0; &#xA0; nill, &quot;1C1D6A&quot;]<br>}</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">re. the nill values: Yahtzy wasn&apos;t on the repo in JavaScript, and&#xA0;<span>Gilded Rose in Ruby I just didn&apos;t re-port (ran out of time)</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There&apos;s even <em>more</em> on Emily&apos;s Github repo, but Cyber-Dojo doesn&apos;t offer SmallTalk (<em>unless</em> someone has forked CD somewhere so that it does<em>?!</em>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you Emily. &#xA0;These made for a GREAT legacy code retreat.</span></p>
