<p>First of all I would like to thank my facilitation counterpart <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/#!/adibolb">Adrian Bolboaca</a>&#xA0;for all our coderetreats. I&apos;m glad to be able to team up with this guy everytime.</p>
<p>We had loads of people joining us with a lot of new guys in the group that were new to TDD and pair programming as well. &quot;Tdd as if you meant it&quot; had a really big impact on a couple of the newbies which was a bit of a surprise for us. At the same time it was my personal highlight of this edition.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also read a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wp.me/p1di0L-P">more detailed report</a> on the retreat.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Thanks again to Corey, Jim and all the facilitators out there for making this happen. We&apos;re already planning new retreats for 2012 and looking forward to GDCR12.</p>
