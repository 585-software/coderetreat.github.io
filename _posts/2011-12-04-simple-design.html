<p>Yesterday I attended the&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2011"><em>Global Day of Code Retreat, 2011</em></a>&#xA0;in Sydney. We were incredibly privileged to have the creator of Code Retreat,&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/coreyhaines">Corey Haines</a>&#xA0;facilitating.</p>
<p>I found the experience to be really very profound and recommend it without reserve to developers of all levels.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I took from the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>My C++/RUP based thinking of OO really needs a makeover</li>
<li>I thought I was practising Test Driven Development (TDD) but I now see how narrow my understanding of TDD was. The&#xA0;<em>evil coder</em>&#xA0;or&#xA0;<em>Mute with Find the Loophole</em>&#xA0;session of the retreat was simultaneously hilarious, frustrating and enlightening on how well tests actually serve as a specification for code</li>
<li>The principles of&#xA0;<em>Simple Design</em>&#xA0;(attributed to the best of my knowledge to Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries in the Extreme Programming book)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x2019;ve come across each of the 4 principles of simple design but when I heard Corey talk through them in sequence, it really made a difference to the way I understand them. I know that this understanding will change as I practice with them and I will not remember them as well when I am in the thick of the work day, so I&#x2019;m writing them down here as a note to self:</p>
<ol>
<li>Runs all the tests</li>
<li>Expresses every idea that we need to express</li>
<li>Says everything once and only once</li>
<li>Has no superfluous parts</li>
</ol>
<p>I look forward to practicing the principles I learned at code retreat. I have no doubt that I have had a step change in my perspective as a programmer - more power to Corey&#x2019;s efforts at&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://coderetreat.org/">coderetreat.org</a>&#xA0;I say!</p>
