<h1>CodeRetreat with Corey Haines v2012</h1>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>CodeRetreat rocks, and the Law of Demeter makes sense to me now (it means you don&#x2019;t reach into other objects).</p>
<p>Also, attend any CodeRetreat you can, especially if Corey is facilitating.</p>

<h2 id="its_6am_we_got_a_full_tank_of_gas_and_140_miles_hit_it">It&#x2019;s 6am, we got a full tank of gas and ~140 miles. Hit it.</h2>
<p>I would like to give a special thanks to Greg Malcolm for helping me to get home from CodeMash then to and from CodeRetreat. Greg is an awesome person to spend time with and I know that the Dev community will continue to be great with people like him in it.</p>
<h2 id="session_1_ed">Session 1 (Ed)</h2>
<p>The first session I paired with Ed. Ed normally does .NET and C#, and I normally do Ruby, but we were able to work well together in JavaScript using <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tryjasmine.com">tryjasmine.com</a>. While we deleted the code (and tests) half way through to start again, we still had a great time and it gave a great start to the day.</p>
<h2 id="session_2_jon">Session 2 (Jon)</h2>
<p>My second pair, Jon, is a Rubyist from Pittsburgh, who works with a startup. Pairing with him was fun, and we took an interesting route. We chose to work on the grid, something that I have always avoided, as it seems to be one of the harder problems. However, once we got started, it seemed to be going well.</p>
<h2 id="session_3_zack">Session 3 (Zack)</h2>
<p>After Lunch, Corey challenged us to have a silent pairing session. Zack and I have debated whether or not this could work, so I decided to pair with him. I was really surprised at how easily we worked in silence. I hope to do more silent pairing with him over the next few months.</p>
<h2 id="session_4_steve">Session 4 (Steve)</h2>
<p>During the fourth session, I had the opportunity to pair with Steve. I couldn&#x2019;t believe the things I learned in pairing with him. I learned more about ducktyping and polymorphism. He explained the Law of Demeter in a way that I understood. He is an excellent pair, and I will be taking this experience with me as I continue on my path.</p>
<h2 id="session_5_josh">Session 5 (Josh)</h2>
<p>In our final session, I paired with Josh. We chose clojure, but my grasp of Functional Programming is still weak. I seemed to be grasping for an Object-Oriented approach as much as I could, and I knew it was making it harder to pair. I hope to work on my understanding and will enjoy pairing with Josh in the future.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>I had a great time at CodeRetreat. I will be looking forward to my next opportunity to go to a CodeRetreat with excitement.</p>
