title: First in-house experiment
preview: I facilitated my first in-house coderetreat last week. It was weird not to have my partner in crimes with me but I managed. For this workshop, I had to add a little bit of theory between sessions, really explaining the basics of TDD and giving some more context around the 4 elements of simple design. So we only got to do 5 sessions. People really responded well to most of the constraints although it forced them to go outside of their comfort zone. Especially the TDD as if you meant it was hard, that's why we decided to do 2 of those, just to get the feeling of it.
