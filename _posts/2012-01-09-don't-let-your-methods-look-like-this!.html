<p>I drew this picture with Corey Haines at the Krakow April 2011 Code Retreat. I started with the overall silhouette of the method, and Corey added the eye and the comment. In the end, I think we got an excellent motivational poster. So, developers, don&apos;t let your methods look like this!</p>
<p>The right bottom corner is about another thing you should remember: at least know the name of your pair before starting to program. It&apos;s funny how many times I&apos;ve seen developers jumping right into the problem and forget this simple thing.</p>
<p>In the end, many thanks to the people who made the Code Retreat Krakow such an amazing experience. Pair facilitating with Corey is always an awesome experience, and I&apos;d love to do it more often. I loved the energy of the participants and I&apos;m really proud of the T-Shirt. Corey, Krakow, see you again soon!</p>
