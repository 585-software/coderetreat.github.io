<p>The <strong>Saturday, October 22nd</strong> is getting closer and with it the Global Day of Coderetreat 2016. It's now the time to consider how you'll participate in the event. Here are the possibilities:<br> <br> You can <strong>participate</strong>            in a local coderetreat and freeing yourself to experiment and try new techniques, learning from each other, writing the best code you can by focusing on some basic principles of well-written code and challenging many of our everyday assumption.
  Interested? Information about local events will be published on the&nbsp;<a href="http://gdcr.coderetreat.org/" target="_blank">GDCR Website</a> and the <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events/event/listByType?type=gdcr16" target="_self">coderetreat.org events section</a>.<br>            <br> You want to help others enjoy GDCR and raise the bar in our industry? You should organize a local event.<br> <br> You can <strong>host</strong> a coderetreat of your own in your city. Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding
  a local sponsor, running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration. Don't worry if you haven't hosted a coderetreat yet. We are here to support you and we will provide you many resources to help you organize an amazing
  event. If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat in your city for GDCR 2016, please submit <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Px0ytk6ZS7ZQAdew1" target="_blank">this form</a> and we will add you to the facilitator/host mailing lists where you
  can get help from other facilitators and hosts from around the world.<br> <br> Every coderetreat needs a <strong>facilitator</strong> as well. Facilitators guide participants through the exercises and lead the retrospectives. Don't worry if
