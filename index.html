          Coderetreats are run by volunteers who want to help out
          their local developer community.
          Hosts handle all of the logistics,
          and facilitators guide participants through the exercises.
          </p> <p>
          Coderetreats are easy to organize and facilitate.  Most of all, they are a lot of fun and a great way
          to meet other developers in your area!
          </p> <p>
