# Registering your event at coderetreat.org

This year, registering your event at coderetreat.org is easier than it has ever been! Like a lot of other community events, we're using a *Pull Request*-based process for registrations. All you need to do is fork [this repository](https://github.com/coderetreat/coderetreat.github.io) and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/coderetreat/coderetreat.github.io#registering-your-event). Travis CI will make sure your Pull Request is fine (your JSON should show up [here](https://travis-ci.org/coderetreat/coderetreat.github.io/builds/229542435#L209) in the test output) and we will then merge it as soon as possible.

Your JSON should follow [this schema](https://github.com/coderetreat/coderetreat.github.io/blob/master/events/event_schema.json). To help you with that, you can generate a valid JSON below:
